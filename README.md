# WHISKER-CHASE


 Step 1: Start the Game
1. Launch the Game: Open the "Cat Whisker chase" game on Microsoft MakeCode Arcade or the platform you built it on.
2. Understand the Objective: The goal is for the cat (the player) to catch the mouse (the target) as quickly as possible.

 Step 2: Control the Cat
1. Movement Controls: Use the arrow keys (or the keys designated in the game) to move the cat around the screen.
   Navigating the Arena: Guide the cat carefully to avoid obstacles and make quick turns to get closer to the mouse.
 Step 3: Chase the Mouse
1. Locate the Mouse:Keep an eye on the mouse's position on the screen. The mouse may move around, so you’ll need to adapt quickly.
2. Plan Your Approach: Try to anticipate where the mouse is moving to catch it more easily.
4. Closing in: When the cat gets close enough to the mouse, the catch will automatically happen if you reach the target range.

Step 4: Winning the Game
1. Catch the Mouse: Once the cat catches the mouse, you’ll hear a sound (if there’s one programmed) or see a visual cue that indicates a successful catch.
2. Advance or Restart: After catching the mouse, you may either proceed to the next level if the game has multiple levels or reset to try again.

Enjoy the game, and best of luck catching that mouse! Let me know if you'd like help with additional features, like adding levels or making the game more challenging.
